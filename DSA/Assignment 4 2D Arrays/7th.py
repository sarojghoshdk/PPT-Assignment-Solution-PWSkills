💡 **Question 7**
You are given an m x n matrix M initialized with all 0's and an array of operations ops, where ops[i] = [ai, bi] means M[x][y] should be incremented by one for all 0 <= x < ai and 0 <= y < bi.

Count and return *the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations*

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3]]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.'''

def maxCount(m, n, ops):
        min_y = m
        min_x = n

        for y, x in ops:
            min_y = min(min_y, y)
            min_x = min(min_x, x)

        return min_x * min_y

m = 3 
n = 3 
ops = [[2,2],[3,3]]
x = maxCount(m,n,ops)
print(x)
